### Interior Parametrics  
Parsons School of Design  
Constructed Environments Department  
University undergraduate degree students with restrictions  
Fall  
Prereq: PUID 2010 Design Studio 1 or PUAD 2010 Design Studio 1 or PUPD 2010 Design Studio 1  
In this course students will study the meaning of parametric design in order to create parametric models. Parametric design supports a flexible, iterative design process that employs a system of parameters related by logic in order to generate a design. Parametric Design proposals are readily adaptable to changing design criteria and customizable to various users and environments.
