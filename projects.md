### [Geometrid Pavilion](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/geometrid-pavilion/)
`Physical Prototyping` | `Structural Design`  
Collaborating with CORE studio designed, engineered, fabricated and installed a temporary pavilion for the 2015 International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS) Symposium. The pavilion, entitled Geometrid (a type of moth that originates as an inch worm), is an 8 meter long kinetic structure that “pulses” through a programmed sequence radically changing in diameter through the expansion and contraction of 8 scissor rings spaced along the central truss.

### [Algorithmic Design and Analysis of Architectural Origami](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321989880_Algorithmic_Design_and_Analysis_of_Architectural_Origami)
`Origami` | `Folded Shell Structures` | `Computational Design`  
Exploring the ability of folded origami tessellations to adapt to free-form surface configurations and to evaluate the structural behavior of these folded tessellations for architectural and engineering applications. A mathematical exploration of the kinematics of folding provides the basis for understanding the relationship between the geometric parameters of the Miura-Ori origami fold pattern and the flexibility of the three-dimensional folded form.

### [Inter-performing Environments:IN-BETWE-EN](http://www.i-m.mx/Biloria/IM_Biloria/interperforming-environments)
`Tangible Interfaces` | `Robotics` | `Human Psychology` | `Structure Morphing`  
Project focuses on exploring notions of collective behaviour of human movement rather than an individual response mechanism, as is common in many installations. The idea of working with an in-between tangible and ambient interface, which can be influenced by people on either sides of the construct is thus manifested.
